# 🎨 Quick Doodle

Quick Doodle is a lightweight macOS application that allows you to draw directly on your screen with ease. Designed for quick annotations, sketches, or presentations, it seamlessly integrates into your workflow.

## 🛠 Features

- Toggle visibility of your drawing without losing progress.
- Undo, redo, clear, or reset your canvas with shortcuts.
- Minimal and intuitive UI with tray icon control.

## 📦 Download

⚠️ **Note:** This app is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate.  
When opening it for the first time, macOS may say:

> “Quick Doodle” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.

Don’t worry — the app is fine. macOS adds a quarantine flag to unsigned apps downloaded from the internet.


### 🛠️ To fix this:

1. Open the **Terminal**.
2. Paste and run the following command:

``bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Quick\ Doodle.app
``
>(If you installed it elsewhere, update the path accordingly.)

Now it should open without any issues! 🎉

## 🚀 How It Works
### Tray Icon Controls
- **Right-click** on the tray icon to open the app menu.
- Click **again** to close it.
- **Left-click** on the tray icon to start drawing. The icon will turn **green** to indicate drawing mode is active.
- Click **again** to stop drawing.
